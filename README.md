Memory Board Game to match hidden pairs
The object of the game is to find matching pairs hidden on the board.  First select a square, then select another square to see if you find a match.  If the squares match, you "win" that match.  If the pair does not match, the squares will turn back over.  To score - try to find the matches in as few moves as possible and in the least amount of time.
